### **Introduction**
*Manifest snakes from the comfort of home.*
This program is intended to help visualize the full adult size of reptiles commonly found in the pet reptile trade. Using Unity and Vuforia, it targets an image on a peice of notebook paper and then displays a 3D VR model of the chosen reptile's approximate size, scaled to the notebook paper.

#### **File Placement**
The sheer size of the Unity project folder makes uploading the entire folder impractical. The version of Unity used is Unity 2018.3.11, and the version of Vuforia used is Vuforia Core Sample 8.1.7 for Unity.

The ScaleCompiles and ScaleCompiles.unity.meta files should be placed in the Assets folder of the main Unity project.

The ScaleSheet folder and ScaleSheet.meta both go in /Assets/Editor/Vuforia/ImageTargetTextures of the Unity project folder.
